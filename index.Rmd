## Macro economics
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#tq_get(x, get = "stock.prices", complete_cases = TRUE, ...)
#DGS10<-tq_get('DGS10',get="economic.data",from="1947-01-01", to="2021-6-17")
getSymbols('DGS10', src='FRED')
tail(DGS10)

chart_Series(DGS10,subset='2012::2021-06')
```

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
